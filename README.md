## Local Development

**Pre-requisites** You should have installed Node.js v16. The best way to manage your local Node.js version is [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

For local development please follow next steps:
- clone repo
- install dependencies with `yarn`
- clone `env.example` into local env file `env.local` (see explanation of all used environment variables [below](#environment-variables))
- run `yarn dev` to spin up local dev server and navigate to the host from logs output

## Environment variables
